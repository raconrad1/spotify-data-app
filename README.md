**Spotify Extended Listening History Application**

Spotify’s annual “Spotify Wrapped” is a highly anticipated review that offers users a snapshot of their music listening habits over the past year — highlighting favorite artists, tracks, genres, and more. It’s a fun way for users to reflect on their musical journey and share insights with friends and family.

Building on that idea, I wanted to create an application that goes deeper by allowing users to explore their entire listening history from the moment they created their Spotify account — not just the past year.

By clicking the “Request Spotify Data” link below, any Spotify user can download their full listening history as a .zip archive containing multiple .json files. These files, while comprehensive, are not very user-friendly on their own. This application allows users to upload that .zip file and instantly transform the raw data into clean, engaging, and insightful visualizations.

Users will get personalized access to:

    - Their top artists, songs, albums, and podcasts over their entire Spotify lifetime
    - Fascinating trivia, such as the very first song they played on Spotify and when
    - Unique statistics like an estimate of how much revenue their listening activity has generated for artists (spoiler: it’s less than you might think)
    - And more!

I’m excited to share this tool and would love to hear from others about what additional stats or insights they’d find interesting when analyzing their complete Spotify listening history.
